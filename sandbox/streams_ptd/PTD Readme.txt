PTD = Public Traffic Data

Email from Rick McGuire:
The PTD is hosted by Transmax at Transmax (as far as I know).
The PTD is available on the TMR corporate network (via the internet) at:

	https://publictrafficdata.transmax.com.au:22026/default.aspx

I am unsure if the PTD is available over the ITS network, I will ask Transmax
