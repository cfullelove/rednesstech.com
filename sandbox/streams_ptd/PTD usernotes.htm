<h3>STREAMS 2011.1</h3>
   <h4>PTD</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>Controlled Intersections, Detector Site and Vehicle Detector Data on PTD Web Interface</li>
      <p>Configuration data for controlled intersections, detector sites and vehicle detectors is now also available on the PTD web interface, under the 'Controlled Intersections', 'Detector Sites' and 'Vehicle Detector Configuration' links, respectively.<br>Vehicle Detector 5-minute volume and occupancy data is available, under the 'Vehicle Detector 5 min Vol/Occ' link. Historical volume and occupancy lists based on this data are also available, for up to 1 hour at a time (with a default of 15 minutes), via the time-based search boxes provided.</p>
      <em>[Enhancement Reference# STREAMS-19516]</em>
      <li>PTD Web Interface Provides Volume/Occupany Vehicle Detector Data, at 5 Minute Intervals</li>
      <p>5-minute vehicle detector measures are now available on the PTD web interface, from the 'Vehicle Detector 5 min Vol/Occ' link. The data for each row is: DetectorId, ClusterId, StartTime, Volume, Occupancy. Note that StartTime is in "yyyyMMddHHmmss" format.</p>
      <em>[Enhancement Reference# STREAMS-19518]</em>
      <li>Controlled Intersections List on Public Traffic Data Web Interface</li>
      <p>The new list for Controlled Intersections configuration data has the following fields:<br>&lt;IntersectionControllerId&gt; &lt;ClusterId&gt; &lt;IntersectionNumber&gt; &lt;FpConnectedTo&gt; &lt;ControllerType&gt; &lt;DefaultIg&gt; &lt;Description&gt; &lt;Enabled &lt;KeepWithNeighbour&gt; &lt;MinCycleTime&gt; &lt;MaxCycleTime&gt; &lt;IntersectionName&gt; &lt;Notes&gt; &lt;Organisation_Name&gt; &lt;Port&gt; &lt;SoftwareVersion&gt; &lt;SoftwareRevision&gt; &lt;Traffic_System_Name&gt; &lt;UBDReference&gt; &lt;X&gt; &lt;Y&gt; &lt;CurrentChecksum&gt; &lt;ExpectedChecksum&gt; &lt;DataState&gt; &lt;TimeSettingState&gt; &lt;TransCycleMinState&gt;</p>
      <em>[Enhancement Reference# STREAMS-19519]</em>
      <li>PTD Web Interface Access Permissions for Volume/Occupancy Measures</li>
      <p>User access to the new volume/occupancy measures, vehicle detector configuration and measures, and detector site configuration data is via the setting of corresponding permissions for each user in the PTD Configuration file, on the PTD Application Server.</p>
      <em>[Enhancement Reference# STREAMS-21067]</em>
      <li>PTD Web Interface Provides Vehicle Detector Configuration Data</li>
      <p>Vehicle Detector configuration data has been provided in the following format for each detector: DetectorId, ClusterId, Build_Stats, Classification_Enabled, Comm_Settings, Description, Distance_Normalisation, Driver, External_Id, FP_Id, Instantaneous_Enabled, Length_Alert_Threshold, Length_Normalisation, Monitoring_Enabled, Name, Notes, Occupancy_Used, Operating_Mode, Organisation_Id, Remote_Id, Speed_Alert_Threshold, Speed_Calibration_Factor, Traffic_System_Id, Hardware_Type.</p>
      <em>[Enhancement Reference# STREAMS-21068]</em>
      <li>PTD Web Interface Vehicle Detector Volume/Occupancy Data History Retrieval</li>
      <p>A block of volume and occupancy 5min values for a constrained time range can be retrieved in the PTD web interface by using the date-range text boxes provided for historical data retrieval. This data is retrieved from STREAMS DLX files and thus may be queried at any time. Retention periods for associated vehicle detector measures apply. The maximum retrieval period at one time is 1 hour. Note that date-ranges must be entered in "yyyyMMddHHmm" UTC format.</p>
      <em>[Enhancement Reference# STREAMS-21069]</em>
      <li>Email Technical Support Email Address on Server Loss of Communications</li>
      <p>Through the use of the Platform Monitor software, a schedule task on the PTD server regularly checks its connections to the nominated STREAMS servers. If communications with any server is down, an email of the failure is sent to the Technical Support email address. This address list is configurable.</p>
      <em>[Enhancement Reference# STREAMS-21229]</em>
      <li>PTD Web Interface Performance Enhancements</li>
      <p>A number of performance enhancement measures have been implemented to improve the time taken for data refreshes in the PTD aggregate lists.</p>
      <em>[Defect Reference# STREAMS-23012]</em>
      <li>Format of Link Coordinates</li>
      <p>The format of link coordinates now conforms to the PTD public interface specification. This  means that the PTD Web Interface now shows link coordinates in lat:long pairs, instead of long:lat pairs.</p>
      <em>[Defect Reference# STREAMS-24164]</em>
      <li>National Performance Indicator Links (NPI) Page on Public Traffic Data (PTD) interface includes Road, Suburb, and Coloured Roads GIS Coordinates</li>
      <p>Coloured roads information (that is, link GIS coordinates) have been added to NPI links on the PTD interface. 'Road' and 'Suburb' information has also been appended to each NPI record, preceding the set of coloured roads GIS coordinates, in the order: Road, Suburb, CentrelinePolyline. For NPI links spanning multiple roads/suburbs, either the most commonly used road/suburb is chosen, or the first in alphabetical order.</p>
